		Installation of the chess macros
		--------------------------------

If you are already using the chess1.1 package then proceed with
`Upgrading to 1.2' otherwise proceed with `Installation of the fonts and
the chess-style'.

1. Upgrading to 1.2
-------------------
To use version 1.2 of the chess macros you must:
  - install the babel package
  - install the new chess.sty file
  - rename font chessfig10 into chessf10 (both the tfm-file and the pk-file)
  - read the CHANGES12 file.

1.1 Install the babel package
-----------------------------
I have included only those parts of the babel-3.0b package that are used by
the chess macros and example files. You can get the complete babel-package 
from one of the following sources:
	bitnet: 
	  * LISTSERV@HEARN.BITNET   (Europe)
		To get a list of all available files send the following
		message:
			get tex-nl filelist
		To get the babel package send the message (you will need
		`uudecode' and `zoo' in order to unpack the archive):
			send babel zoouue
	  * ymir.claremont.edu      (USA)
	internet: sol.cs.ruu.nl     (Europe)
	   via anonymous ftp 
	     from TEX/NTG/babel.zoo
	
In order to use the new chess macros you will need:
	babel.switch
	chess12/inputs/babel[22|33].switch
	chess12/inputs/babel.sty
	chess12/inputs/latexhax.sty
	chess12/inputs/english.sty
	chess12/inputs/dutch.sty
[	chess12/inputs/german.sty
	chess12/inputs/french.sty
	chess12/inputs/YOUR-LANGUAGE.sty ]

Babel.switch is the file that handles language switching. If you use an
old version of TeX (pre 3.0) then you have to use babel22.switch otherwise
you will need babel33.switch. Only in the last case you will have full
language support. Install the above files by copying them to a directory
which is in your TEXINPUTS path. Copy either babel22.switch or
babel33.switch as babel.switch to the same directory.

1.2 Install the new chess.sty file
----------------------------------
Copy chess12/inputs/chess.sty to a directory which is in your TEXINPUTS path.

1.3 Rename font chessfig10 into chessf10
----------------------------------------
Rename your chessfig10.tfm into chessf10.tfm and your chessfig10.300pk
into chessf10.300pk. This change is a service for our MSDOS users
(including the TUGboat editors).

You are ready to use the new macros. Read the file CHANGES12 to know
what changes might be of importance to you.


2. Installing the fonts and the chess-style
-------------------------------------------
Lots of people have a laserprinter with a Canon Engine (300dpi, write
black).  For those people I have included the pkfonts and the tfm-files. 
Installation of the chess-style and chessfonts, in this case, consists of
the following steps (otherwise proceed with 3.):

Installation of the chess macros should be very simple. The package consists 
of four different parts:
   A) style files:
	chess12/inputs/chess.sty		(chess)
	chess12/inputs/babel22.switch		(babel)
	chess12/inputs/babel33.switch		(babel)
	chess12/inputs/babel.sty		(babel)
	chess12/inputs/latexhax.sty		(babel)
	chess12/inputs/english.sty		(babel)
	chess12/inputs/dutch.sty		(babel)
      [ chess12/inputs/a4.sty			(optional)
        chess12/inputs/a4wide.sty		(optional)
        chess12/inputs/fancyheadings.sty	(optional)
        chess12/inputs/2side.tex		(optional) ]

     These files consists of the chess macros and part of the babel
     package (see 1.2 how the full package can be obtained). Find out
     where your style (.sty) files are kept. (If you don't have
     permission to put the files on that place then you can put them 
     where you like. But in this case you have to add that place to the 
     TEXINPUTS search path so that TeX and LaTeX can locate them. Try to 
     find out how that works for your system.)
      
     If you use an old version of TeX (before 3.0) then you must copy 
     babel22.switch otherwise babel33.switch as babel.switch to the
     place you have choosen. The rest of the files can be copied 
     straight away. If you have already babel then you only need to
     copy chess.sty. The files between [ ... ] are optional. I have 
     included them for completeness because they are used somewhere 
     in the example files. 

===> step a) install chess and babel style files
	     [eventually adapt your TEXINPUTS search path]

   B) TeX font metric files:
	chess12/fonts/chess20.tfm		(chess)
       	chess12/fonts/chessf10.tfm		(chess)
      [ chess12/fonts/chess10.tfm		(chess)
	chess12/fonts/chess30.tfm		(chess) ]

     This part is needed by TeX and LaTeX too because they contain the
     metrics and kerning information of the fonts. Put the files in the
     same directory as where the other .tfm files are kept. (If you 
     don't have permission to put the files there then you can put them 
     where you like. But in this case you have to add that place to the 
     TEXFONTS search path so that TeX and LaTeX can locate them. Try to 
     find out how that works for your system.)

     The files between [ ... ] are not used by the chess.sty macros. If 
     you want to use them you may copy them also to the destination you 
     have choosen. The file chess12/doc/boards.ltx shows how you can use 
     them in LaTeX.
      
===> step b) install .tfm files
	     [eventually adapt your TEXFONTS search path]

   C) TeX packed font files:
	chess12/pkfonts/chess20.300pk		(chess)
       	chess12/pkfonts/chessf10.300pk		(chess)
      [	chess12/pkfonts/chess10.300pk		(chess)
	chess12/pkfonts/chess30.300pk		(chess) ]

     This is perhaps the most cumbersome step in the installation. Not
     because it is really difficult but because there are so many 
     different printers, previewers and drivers. Not to speak of the
     bloody limit of the three character extension of MSDOS.
     
     Try to find out how and where the pk-files are kept on your system
     (if you use the old fashioned pxl or gf-files you are really out of
     date!). If your system keeps the pk-files in directories ordered 
     by fontsize the above fonts have perhaps to be renamed into:
     	/usr/local/lib/tex/pkfonts/chess20.300pk (UNIX)
     	TEX_ROOT:[fonts.300]chess20.pk		 (VAX-VMS/DECUS-TeX)
     	TeX:pk/300/chess20.300pk		 (??AmigaTeX??)
     	emtex\pixel.lj\300dpi\chess20.pk	 (emTeX)
     	
     If you don't have permission to put the files on the place where the 
     other pk-files are kept then you can put them where you like. But in
     this case you have to add that place to the search path of your 
     favourite driver (TEXPKS for the PostScript driver `dvips' available on
     almost every system--recommended!) and previewer (XDVIFONTS for
     xdvi, this previewer runs on X-based terminals). Try to find out how 
     that works on your system. 

===> step c) install pk-files
             [eventually adapt your driver and previewer search paths]

   D) Documentation and example files
	chess12/doc/boards.ltx	LaTeX source demonstrating the 3 chess fonts
	chess12/doc/TUGboat.ltx		TUGboat article (LaTeX main-source)
	chess12/doc/TUGgame.ltx		TUGboat article (LaTeX inputted-source)
	chess12/doc/tal.ltx		Fisher vs. Tal (LaTeX source)
	chess12/doc/tal.tex		Fisher vs. Tal (TeX source)
	chess12/doc/Symbols.tex		Informator symbols (TeX-version)
	chess12/doc/Symbols.ltx		Informator symbols (LaTeX-version)
	chess12/doc/Kasparov.ltx	Informator style example
	chess12/doc/SchaakMaatje.ltx	our chess club magazine (Dutch!)
	chess12/doc/dutch-tt.ltx	dutch LaTeX torture test
	chess12/doc/dutch-tt.tex	dutch TeX torture test

===> step d) print documentation
             [eventually adapt your TEXINPUTS search path so chess12/inputs
              is temporary included]
             
     You are now ready to use the chess macros. Print the documentation 
     available in chess12/doc. The main documentation consists of the 
     article (TUGboat.ltx and TUGgame.ltx) that will appear in TUGboat 
     and the complete game of Fisher against Tal (tal.ltx and tal.tex).
     For testing the chessfonts on your printer or previewer I have 
     included boards.ltx with its dvi-file and its PostScript output (.ps).
     For those who are not afraid to read Dutch there is a SchaakMaatje.ltx 
     the magazine I made for our chess club. This example shows how the 
     language support for Dutch is used.
     For testing new versions of chess.sty you may use the torture tests.

3. Generating the fonts.
------------------------
To generate the chess fonts you need METAFONT (the actual program needed
is `mf').

To install font <font> (ex. chess20) you must:
 a) generate `<font>.tfm' and `<font>.<dpi>gf' (<dpi> is 
    a number depending on the resolution of your output device: 100 for 
    the AmigaTeX previewer, 300 for most popular laserprinters):
    
       mf "\mode:=<mode>; mag:=magstep(<magstep>); input <font>"
    
    Here <mode> should be:
      localfont  if METAFONT is installed properly and localfont has been
                 set to the parameters needed for your local printer
      amiga      if you want to generate fonts for the AmigaTeX previewer.
    
    Anyway <mode> should have a value that guarantees that you use the
    optimal settings when METAFONT generates fonts for YOUR printer or
    previewer.
      
    Here <magstep> should be a suitable value to generate the wanted
    magnification. Zero (0) generates a true sized font, 1 a font that
    is 1.2 times and -1 a font that is 1/1.2 times magnified. Normally
    you do need only true sized fonts (<magstep>=0) but with the
    AmigaTeX previewer it is handy to have magsteps -0.5, 0 and 1.

 b) Although some printer drivers accept gf-files and pxl-files, pk-files
    are preferred because they occupy less disk space. To convert from
    gf to pk format you need the program `gftopk':

       gftopk <font>.<dpi>gf

 c) Proceed with 2.

4.  Other remarks 
-----------------
If you use xdvi (UNIX and VAX-VMS) as previewer, as I do on my NCD16
terminal at work, you don't need extra previewer fonts.  To get nice
chessdiagrams with this previewer you need to set the density (S) to 33. 

To get optimal convenience with the previewer of your AmigaTeX, in case
you don't have a hard disk as I do, you can make an extra font disk (ex. 
Black.Myfonts), thanks to the unique font cashing scheme implemented by
Tomas Rokicki.  Consult your AmigaTeX manual. 
    
The chessdiag.mf METAFONT source in chess12/mf draws a `mate in three
problem' on the screen if your `mf' has graphical support. To draw on
the screen you need the following command:
   mf "\mode=localfont; mag=magstep(2); screenchars; input chessdiag"
    	
If you like to make a nice T-shirt or magnified chessboard, try:
   mf "\mode=proof; mag=magstep(0); input chess20"
   gftodvi chess20.2600gf
   dvips chess20
    	
Success!
