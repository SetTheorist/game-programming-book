		      Chess fonts and a chess style
                      -----------------------------
                       (Version 1.2 / Febr. 1992)

This is version 1.2 of my chessmacros for typesetting chess with LaTeX
and/or TeX.  This new version contains an improved chess style file
(chess.sty) complete with documentation and example files.  The
documentation is the article as it will appear in TUGboat.  You will
also find examples of complete chess games and a list of all available
Informator symbols in the directory `doc':
  - TUGboat.ltx		TUGboat article (tugboat macros not included
  - TUGgame.ltx		in this package)
  - tal.ltx		Tal-Fisher in LaTeX
  - tal.tex		Tal-Fisher in TeX
  - Kasparov.ltx	Kasparov-Karpov in Informator style
  - Symbols.ltx		Informator symbols in LaTeX
  - Symbols.tex		Informator symbols in TeX
  - SchaakMaatje.ltx    example of chess magazine (Dutch!)

File CHANGES12 contains a summary of the differences between this
version and version 1.1. The main differences are:
  a) improved plain TeX interface
  b) language support using the babel package from Johannes Braams
  c) nochess-environment replaces chess-environment
  d) font chessfig10 renamed into chessf10 (MSDOS)
  e) handling of promotion improved
  f) `en passant capture' bug solved
  g) added Informator symbols
Note that b), c) and d) makes this version incompatible with the older
versions. Read the file INSTALLATION how to upgrade from 1.1 to 1.2.

For UNIX people I have added a Makefile:
  - make (generates the fonts and the documentation)
      --> change `localfont' into whatever your mode is (ex.: imagen)
          if localfont is not properly set at your system. The command:
             mf "\mode=localfont; input chess20"
          should generate a font suitable for your local printer.
      --> if you don't use a PostScript printer or don't use dvips
          you have to adapt the Makefile to your local situation

  - make install (installs the fonts and the style: check the path's!).

Have a lot of chess writing and playing fun!
