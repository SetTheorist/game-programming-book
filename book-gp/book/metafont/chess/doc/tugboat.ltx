\maketitle

\noindent
The Berkeley Font Catalogue~\cite{Berkeley} demonstrates how a chess font
in combination with troff can be used to typeset chess diagrams.  This
article has inspired me to build a chess font with \MF\ from the nice
font, see diagram~1, I once bought from Schaakhuis De Haan (Arnhem,
The Netherlands).
\begin{figure}

\end{figure}
This `font' consists of a set of chess boards and separate sets of
chess pieces.  The pieces have to be pasted on the board after pulling
them from a sheet of paper.  This nowadays is still common practice
for publishers.  Before I used \MF\ I made enlargements of the
pieces on graph-paper using my stereo microscope for which I have a
drawing prism.  This graph-paper makes it easy to read the coordinates
of points that need to be given to \MF.  For the development of the
font I have used Amiga\MF\ which has graphical support.  The design
of the chess style has been done with Amiga\TeX.  Both programs run
comfortably on my private Amiga1000 with 2.5 Megabytes of internal
memory.

A chess font consists of 26 characters, with one character for the empty
light square and one for the empty dark square.  For each chess piece
(Pawn, kNight, Bishop, Rook, Queen, King) there are four characters to
represent that piece (White, Black) on both squares (light, dark).  The
troff chess font has also extra characters for the border of the board. 
These borders are added by the chess diagram macros as horizontal and
vertical rules in my approach.  Table~1 shows all characters from font
{\tt chess10} (the size of a square being 10 points). 
\begin{table}
\begin{flushleft}\tt
\newfont{\CH}{chess10}
\begin{tabular}{cccccccccc}
P & \CH P & O & \CH O & p & \CH p & o & \CH o & 0 & \CH 0 \\
N & \CH N & M & \CH M & n & \CH n & m & \CH m & Z & \CH Z \\
B & \CH B & A & \CH A & b & \CH b & a & \CH a \\
R & \CH R & S & \CH S & r & \CH r & s & \CH s \\
Q & \CH Q & L & \CH L & q & \CH q & l & \CH l \\
K & \CH K & J & \CH J & k & \CH k & j & \CH j
\end{tabular}
\end{flushleft}
\caption{Character encodings of {\tt chess10}}
\end{table}

There is an extra font {\tt chessf10} that contains only the so-called
chess figurines (King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, kNight). With this font the
move 25.~N5|*|g3, in short algebraic notation, can be typeset as |25. N5*g3|.
Next to {\tt chess10} there are {\tt chess20} and {\tt chess30}. The 20-point
version is used in the chess style because the diagrams made with
it fit nicely in a twocolumn A4 page. But it would be easy to make
another size font by changing only one parameter. 

The king has given me the biggest trouble to {\manual META}fy.  If you
compare the original font with my {\manual META}imitation, you will see
a few differences.  For one thing, the chess board has no labels for
rows and lines.  These can be added to the diagram macros if desired. 
The pieces in the original font use shadings to get a better contrast
with the dark squares.  The rest of the differences have to be ascribed
to my insufficient knowledge of \MF. 

I have long hesitated to publish my {\manual META}copies of the chess
font in \TUB.  I have seriously tried to find the designer or owner of
the original font.  According to the Dutch firm that has taken over
Schaakhuis De Haan, I could safely publish them because the fonts are
not sold any longer.  I hope this article helps in finding the designer
of this very nice chess font and that he is not upset with my {\manual
META}copy of it. 

Having a nice set of chess fonts is one thing; typesetting chess using
them is another thing.  When I accepted the editorship of our
`Schaakmaatje', as my chess club `Schaakclub Geldrop' calls its
chess magazine, I used \TeX\ and some macros to typeset chess diagrams. 
After giving the \LaTeX\ course at our Computer Center, I definitely
wanted to move to this macro set.  Especially the many available styles,
and the need to have a simple macro for typesetting tables, makes
\LaTeX\ a lot simpler to use. 

\begin{position}
\White(Kc2,Bf8,Nb4,b3,g7)
\Black(Ka3,b6)
\end{position}

\subsubsection*{Chess playing macros}
When some macros to play chess in \TeX{} appeared in \TUB~\cite{Appelt},
I used the ideas presented to make my own chess style.  As a typical
example of an annotated chess game I have used a part of the game Fisher
played against Tal during the Candidates' Tournament of 1959.  In this
tournament the sixteen aged Fisher lost four times from Tal who by
winning this tournament earned the right to meet Botvinnik for the world
championship. The game shows a real fight between two very offensive 
players. The game itself is annotated by Fisher.  Both the input
and the output are included on page~\pageref{chessgame}. 

To typeset the main line with automatic updating of the chess position,
{\tt chess.sty} has the macro \verb+\newgame+, which starts a new game, and
the environment {\tt position}, to set up a position other than the
initial one. The chess position after the 25th move in the game
Fisher--Tal (see diagram~3 on page~\pageref{chessgame}) is defined with:
\begin{quote}\small
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{position}
\White(Kh1,Qe6,Re1,a2,b2,c2,g2,h2)
\Black(Kf8,Qb8,Rd7,Rg8,Be7,a6,b4,h7)
\global\Whitetrue\global\movecount=25
\end{position}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}%
\noindent
\verb+\Whitetrue+ gives the turn to White; \verb+\Whitefalse+ gives it
to Black.  Setting the move counter is achieved with
\verb+\movecount=25+.  The \verb+\global+ is needed because both
commands are used inside an environment. 

{\samepage
There exists another macro \verb+\board+ for defining a chess position in
case automatic updating is not wanted. This macro is used for the mate in
three problem (see diagram~2):
\begin{quote}\small
\begin{verbatim}
\board{ * * B *}
      {* * * P }
      { p * * *}
      {* * * * }
      { N * * *}
      {kP* * * }
      { *K* * *}
      {* * * * }
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}}
\begin{nochess} % prevent the `|' to become active!
\noindent
Notice that the user of {\tt chess.sty} doesn't need to know the character
encodings from table~1! He only needs to know the abbreviations of pieces
(uppercase for White and lowercase for Black) and that empty squares are
represented by a \verb*+ + (light) or a \verb+*+ (dark).

To show the board in either case, one needs to call the macro
\verb+\showboard+ or \verb+$$\showboard$$+ if the board should be centered.

To automatically update a position defined by the {\tt position}
environment there are two macros: \verb+\ply+ and \verb+\move+. If
White's move is not followed by some analysis, the macro \verb+\move+
can be used. Otherwise the move has to be broken down into two plies
(half moves) with \verb+\ply+. The argument(s) of \verb+\ply+ and
\verb+\move+ contain the from square followed by the to square of the
moving piece, or the King in case of castling. A square is represented
as a column \verb+[a-h]+ followed by the row \verb+[1-8]+. In
correspondence chess a similar notation is used except for the columns
which are also denoted as decimals \verb+[1-8]+.  I think that using
letters is less confusing and reflects the way at least in Europe
chess players think.

If a pawn arrives at its final destination, it becomes a Queen, Rook,
Bishop or kNight \verb+{Q|R|B|N}+.  If the promotion piece is omitted a
default Queen is taken.  Moves can also be commented with things like
\verb+!+~for good moves, \verb+??+~for exceptional bad moves, and so
on.  So the syntax, in a free style of Extended Backus Naur Form, of an
argument for both \verb+\ply+ and \verb+\move+ can be described as:
\begin{quote}\small
\begin{verbatim}
[a-h][1-8][a-h][1-8]{{Q|R|B|N}comment}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
\end{nochess}
\noindent
The translation of this move representation to long algebraic notation
is carried out by the `invisible' macro \verb+\@ply+.  For example:
\verb+\@ply g1f3+ will result in |Ng1-f3| in case square f3 is empty
or |Ng1*f3| in case of a capture, \verb+\@ply e1c1+ will result in
|0-0-0|.

To update and query the chess board, represented by 64 macros
(\verb+\a1+, \verb+\a2+,\dots\verb+\h8+), \verb+\@ply+ uses the
private macros \verb+\@set+ and \verb+\@get+.  The value of a square
can either be empty (letter \verb+E+), a White piece (\verb+Q+,
\verb+R+, \verb+B+, \verb+N+, \verb+P+) or a Black piece (\verb+q+,
\verb+r+, \verb+b+, \verb+n+, \verb+p+).  To update the chess position
\verb+\@ply g1f3+ does a \verb+\@set[g1](E)+ to make the square g1
empty and a \verb+\@set[f3](N)+ to move the kNight to f3.  The macro
\verb+\@ply+ handles castling and the special pawn moves en passant
capture and promotion.  Because of its length the macro \verb+\@ply+
is not included.  Basically, it is just a set of nested conditionals
to cover all cases.  Instead the macros \verb+\@set+ and \verb+\@get+,
that might be of interest to other \TeX\ applications, are included
here, together with \verb+\@showchar+ (the macro that maps a square
value to the correct character encoding using \verb+\@get+) and
\verb+\@emptyboard+ (a macro for clearing the chess board using
\verb+\@set+).

\subsubsection*{Analysis mode}
In order to save space tournament bulletins often prefer short algebraic
notation.  In this notation the from square of a piece is omitted.  If a
move otherwise would be ambigious, because another piece can reach the
same destination, the letter of the column or the number of the row from
the originating square is added.  The short and long algebraic notation
is also used in analysis mode when we annotate moves from the main line
or a variation.  To make the typesetting of these move notations easy
and compact, I have introduced a pair of \verb+|+\ldots\verb+|+ to
activate the algebraic notation.  Unfortunately this character pair can
not be used within arguments of macros.  But you can of course use the
pair outside the macro like \verb+|\centerline{25.  Kf8!}|+.  Or if you
prefer you can use the {\tt chess}-environment instead.  Because \LaTeX\
uses this character in the {\tt tabular} environment to draw vertical
rules I have made an environment {\tt nochess} that can be used to
prevent that the \verb+|+ character will activate the analysing mode. 
Within the {\tt nochess} environment you can use the environment {\tt
chess} to get analysis mode again.  Here follow some examples to show
how short and long algebraic notation can be generated in analysing
mode:
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\multicolumn{1}{c}{\bf input} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\bf output} \\[.2pt]
\verb^|21. Nf3-e5??, 0-0!|^ & \begin{chess}21. Nf3-e5??, 0-0!\end{chess} \\
\verb^|21.: Ke8*f8|^        & \begin{chess}21.: Ke8*f8       \end{chess} \\
\verb^|21. Nfe5, K*f8|^     & \begin{chess}21. Nfe5, K*f8    \end{chess} \\
\verb^|21.: f8Q+|^          & \begin{chess}21.: f8Q+         \end{chess} 
\end{tabular}
\end{nochess}
\noindent
In the analysing mode some characters have a special meaning. The
`\verb+*+' becomes a `|*|' to denote a capture, the `\verb+-+' is
mapped to `|-|' and the `\verb+:+' is used as an abbreviation for
`|:|' as one need if the analysis starts with a Black move.

The chess macros have also support for different languages thanks to the
possibilities of the babel package from Johannes Braams~\cite{Braams}. 
This package can be used within plain \TeX\ and \LaTeX\ in \TeX3.0 or in
older versions.  The names of the chess pieces can be choosen according
to their Dutch abbreviations by specifying the language {\tt dutch}
before the {\tt chess} style:
\begin{quote}\small
\begin{verbatim}
\documentstyle[dutch,chess]{...}
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
\noindent
In Dutch the letters K (`koning'), D (`dame'), T (`toren'), L (`loper')
and P (`paard') are used to denote the king, queen, rook, bishop and
knight respectivally.  These letters are used in the macros \verb+\move+
and \verb+\ply+, only if you provide a promotion piece, within the
analysis mode and in the {\tt position} environment.  In the
\verb+\board+ macro we use the same letters to denote the White pieces
and the corresponding lowercase letters to indicate the Black piece.  In
this macro we need also a letter to represent the pawn.  Because both
`pion' (pawn) and `paard' (knight) start with a `p' I have choosen the
letter `I' for the `pIon'.

Hopefully the examples above and the extract of the game Fisher--Tal on
page~\pageref{chessgame} are further self explaining.

\subsubsection*{Tournament style}
To illustrate the tournament style I have included the complete
example game of Fisher against Tal from~\cite{Fisher} in the style
that is used in the Chess Informant~\cite{informant}.  In this book
special symbols are used for often used chess terminology.
Table~\ref{symbols} shows the list of the symbols I needed in the
Fisher game.  In ~\cite{Fisher} the moves |50: Kc7 51. Rb5| are
omitted. But this is corrected in his later book~\cite{Fisher80}.

\begin{table}\small
\begin{tabular}{lll}
               & \bf (La)TeX           & \bf meaning \\[.1cm]

\bbetter       & \verb+\bbetter+       & Black stands slightly better \\
\wupperhand    & \verb+\wupperhand+    & White has the upper hand \\
\bupperhand    & \verb+\bupperhand+    & Black has the upper hand \\

\noindent
The mainline is typeset in boldface and the variations in roman. When we
need to typeset a name we have to avoid the analysis mode by using the
{\tt nochess} environment. The {\tt nochess} environment can be used in
\LaTeX\ style (\verb+\begin{nochess}+\ldots\verb+\end{nochess}+) or in
the shorter \TeX\ style (\verb+\nochess+\ldots\verb+\endnochess+).

\subsubsection*{Using plain \TeX}
To use {\tt chess.sty} in plain \TeX\ you need the following line
for including the chess macros:
\begin{quote}\small
\begin{verbatim}
\input chess.sty
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent
The {\tt nochess} and {\tt position} environments from {\tt chess.sty}
should be replaced by \verb+\nochess+ \ldots \verb+\endnochess+ and
\verb+\position+ \ldots \verb+\endposition+ pairs. 

\subsubsection*{Further wishes}
The chess font and the chess style form a good basis for publishing
about chess as is demonstrated by~\cite{Anjo,Rix}.  But there are
still some wishes to make the writing really enjoyable.  My first wish
would be a program with a chess board interface on which I can set up
a position, play a variation and add text to the computer generated
chess moves, go back to the main line, play another variation, and so
on.  I have seen a X11-based chess interface using hyperbuttons which
provides a good starting point to make such a program!

Surely the chess style can be improved and other style conventions
added.  If anybody does so, please let he send me his improvements. 

\subsubsection*{Availability}
This article, the chess fonts and the corresponding style file with the
complete game of Fisher against Tal and other examples can be retrieved
(files {\tt chess.tar.Z} and {\tt chess.README}) from the file server
{\tt sol.cs.ruu.nl (131.211.80.5)} via anonymous ftp from the
directory {\tt TEX}.

\subsubsection*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank Victor Eijkhout for his help and criticism he
gave me to improve both the chess style and the readability of this
article. My thanks go also to Hugo van der Wolf for polishing my
English, and to the {\tt UseNet} users who have sent me bugreports and
have reported inconveniences present in version 1.0.  Most of them are
solved and will be made available in version 1.2.
