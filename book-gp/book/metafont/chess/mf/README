Instructions on how to install the chess fonts can be found in the file
chess12/INSTALLATION.

The file chessdiag.mf allows to create the ``Mate in three'' problem
in a separate window if your version of METAFONT supports it (it should
do that!). There are two versions of this file:
	chessdiag.mf 
	chessdiag.Xmf

The last one can be used to draw the board in a X-window. Here is how:
   - setenv DISPLAY your_server:0
   - mf "\mode:=localfont; mag:=magstep(0); screenchars; input chessdiag.Xmf"
