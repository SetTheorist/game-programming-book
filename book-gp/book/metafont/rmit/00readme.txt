Just remove it. It simply sets up some margins for the correct paper
size here at RMIT.

Hi! I wrote them (see signature below). I have not touched them for
ages. I wanted to learn about TeX, MetaFont, etc. etc. so I had a go
at something that no-one else seemed to have done. In otherwords, it
is a metafont program by a beginner, not by an expert. I also was only
starting to learn Thai, so I dont know how good they are. I since gave
up on Thai and frankly cannot remember much of it any more. I was also
having fun at the time trying to get my Amiga to speak Thai. It was good
for a chuckle.
 
Anyway, if you have any questions, sure, drop a line. I dont know how much
I will be able to help (as from the date you can see the last time I used
any of it). Hope they are useful to someone.
