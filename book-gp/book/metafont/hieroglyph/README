		            IMPORTANT : 

Well, not so important, but : I give this program under the GNU
Licence, and I don't ask for anything... except that I'd like to know
a little what happens to my program. I'd be very glad to receive news
from you, even something short like : "I got it out of sheer
curiosity". If you use it, even a little, I'd be very glad to receive
your comments. A few demo files would also be very welcome.
