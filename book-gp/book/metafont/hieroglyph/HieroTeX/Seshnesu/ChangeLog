	* printf("}\\end{hieroglyph}\\Hfinligne\\begin{hieroglyph}{\\leavevmode\n");
	was needed for correct use of Columns macros. 

Wed Jan  1 18:27:16 1997  Serge Rosmorduc  <rosmord@cachicame>

	* seshSource.txt: added quite a few unusefull codes 

	* seshl.l (traite): correction of an error : [...\t-=] was false 
	because it means "any char from tab to "=". replaced by
	[...\t=-]. Thanks to a problem signaled by MICHAEL GIERHAKE.

	* fonctions.c (affiche_hiero): -! generates \Hfinligne and not the
        old messy stuff.


Wed Jun  7 11:28:29 1995  Serge Rosmorduc  <rosmord@cachou>

	* mklex.awk, hache.c, CONVENTIONS_CHOISIES, hache.h, mynew.h, general.h, fonctions.h, quadra.c, quadra.h, sesh.y, mkliste.awk, seshl.l, seshSource.txt, Makefile, fonctions.c:
	*** empty log message ***
	modifiications cosmetiques.

	* lots of additions ! serekh, Hwt, ... general cleaning up
	of the whole thing.
	* Column-writing
	* new way of archiving the files.

	* Lots of additions :
	- +rl .... +rl allows right-to-left writing in normal tex
	- [[ ]] [& &] and co allows some parenthesing
	- ## is used instead of # for sign overlapping
	  I could have used #, but it is quite ambiguous
	- \! can be used for vertical kerning :
	  D:\!\!\!\!Hr looks fine.

TODO
Some changes should be done : 
- overlapping is badly placed in the grammar And isn't treated at the optimal place.
- the grammar itself should be cleaner; something like that :
  hieroglyphs = a list of overlapping signs
  sign= shading, or hieroglyph, followed by modifiers 
  modifiers = \ (inverse) or \rN rotate by 90degrees
  or \Rnnn = rotate by 1 degrees step
  or \sN size N
- char * strings should be freed ! 
- There should be a construct to allow putting #def #
alone, to ease entry

	* I now use  my new memory management system. Something should also be 
done for char * character strings, As they are currently left alone. sad, sad, 
sad :-( 

Version de sesh fonctionnant correctement sur neo.tex et 
Lefebvre.tex. Reste a implementer la gestion de la memoire et 
les extensions.
