README for bartel-chess-fonts
=============================

The fonts contained in this package are originally distributed
on CTAN in the
	chess-problem-diagrams
(in the directory CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/chess-problem-diagrams)
as
	CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/chess-problem-diagrams/fonts.zip

The original README states:

   The font sources by Elmar Bartel are published under conditions of the 
   GNU General Public License.

This package was create to ease installation, in this process tfm files
for all fonts have been created (but fselch30 and fselch34 which are
broken).

To keep the namespace of metafont files sane, the following files have
been renamed to less generic names:
	bishop.mf	->	elch-bishop.mf
	blackfield.mf	->	elch-blackfield.mf
	chbase.mf	->	elch-chbase.mf
	equi.mf		->	elch-equi.mf
	geo.mf		->	elch-geo.mf
	king.mf		->	elch-king.mf
	knight.mf	->	elch-knight.mf
	pawn.mf		->	elch-pawn.mf
	queen.mf	->	elch-queen.mf
	rook.mf		->	elch-rook.mf
plus the respective input statements in fselch.mf adapted.

Furthermore, the files in the original fonts.zip have been split
into those that are actually needed by the fselch* pkelch* driver 
sources in the root directory, and additional test files
(in the subdirectory doc).

Any complains should be send to 
	tex-live@tug.org
